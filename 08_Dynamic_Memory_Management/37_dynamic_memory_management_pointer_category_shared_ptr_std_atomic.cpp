        Dynamic Memory Management

Smart Pointer:
Smart pointers enable automatic, exception-safe, object lifetime management.

Pointer Category (defined in header <memory>)
    > unique_ptr                    smart pointer with unique object ownership semantics
>>>>> shared_ptr                    smart pointer with shared object ownership semantics
    > weak_ptr                      weak reference to an object managed by std::shared_ptr
    > auto_ptr                      smart pointer with strict object ownership semantics
    helper classes
    > owner_less                    provide mixed-type owner-based ordering of shared and weak pointers
    > enable_shared_from_this       allows an object to create a shared_ptr referring to itself
    > bad_weak_ptr                  exception thrown when accessing a weak_ptr which refers to already destroyed object
    > default_delete                default deleter for unique_ptr
