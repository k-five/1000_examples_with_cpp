Hello everyone.  
I am Shakib. And for experience to myself, I do these examples in c++ language.

Where did these examples come from?  
I just printed out the whole site of: en.cppreference.com
      
Well, maybe you ask why am I doing this stupid work?

First I needed to learn English language, second I needed to learn 10-finger-type
and third I liked learning programming. So I do all three of them together. And I
typed these examples to improve my EN language and TYPING and C++ programming.

I tested all these examples with this command-line argument:  
g++ -std=c++14 -O2 -Wall -pedantic -pthread

On Gnu / Ubuntu 16.01 LTS and code::blocks IDE 16.01 (32 bit)  

If you are confusing with my examples, I apologize to you.
  
You can see the major reference sites:  
    > en.cppreference.com  
    > cplusplus.com  
    > msdn.microsoft.com
