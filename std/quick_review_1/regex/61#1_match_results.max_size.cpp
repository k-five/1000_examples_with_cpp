std::match_results

regex matching operation, each match being of the corresponding "sub_match" type.

It is filled by regex_match, regex_search, or regex_iterator with the results of
the matching operation. The elements in "match_results" object are const-qualified,
and thus are not meant to be modified outside of these function.


some typedef for match_results:

cmatch      equals to typedef match_results< const char*>
smatch      equals to typedef match_results< string::const_iterator >

wcmatch      equals to typedef match_results< const wchar_t* >
wsmatch      equals to typedef match_results< wstring::const_iterator >


    Member function:
        constructor
        destructor
        operator =

    Capacity:
        empty
        size
        max_size

    Iterator:
        begin
        end
        cbegin
        cend

    Element access:
        operator []
        prefix
        suffix
        length
        position
        str

    Formating:
        format

    Swap:
        swap

    Observers:
        ready
        get_allocator

    Non-member function:
        operators( match_result )
        std::swap( match_result )
