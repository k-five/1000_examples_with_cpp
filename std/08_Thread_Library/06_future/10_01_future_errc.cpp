    std::future_errc
    ****************

The scoped enumeration std::future_errc defines the error codes
reported by std::future and related classes in std::future_error
exception objects. Only four error codes are required although
the implementation may defines additional error codes. Because
the appropriate specialization of std::is_error_code_enum is provided,
value of std::future_errc are implicitly convertible to std::error_code

All error code are distinct and non-zero (since C++14)
