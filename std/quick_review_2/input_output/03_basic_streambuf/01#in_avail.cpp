-------------------
the content of the file:
If the get pointer (gptr) has a value and this is less than the end pointer (egptr): The
function returns the number of characters directly available at the get pointer before the end
pointer (i.e., it returns (egptr()-gptr()) without calling any virtual member function).
â€¢ If the get pointer (gptr) is either null or has reached the end pointer (egptr): The function
calls the protected virtual member function showmanyc to obtain the number of characters
expected to be available after an underflow.
