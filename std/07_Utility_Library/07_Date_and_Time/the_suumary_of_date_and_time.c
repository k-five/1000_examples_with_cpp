/*
            Date and Time
            *************


    C++ includes support for two types of time manipulation

*   The chrono library, a flexible collation of types that track time with
    varying degrees of precision (e.g. std::chrono::time_point).

*   C-style date and time library (e.g. std::time)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
chrono library:
    The chrono library defines three main types (durations,clocks,and time points)
    as well as utility functions and command typedefs.

    Duration:
    A duration consists of a span of time, defined as some number of ticks of some
    time unit. For example, "42 seconds" could be represented by a duration consisting
    of 42 ticks of a 1-second time unit.

    1. duration

        > (constructor)   constructs new duration
        > operator=       assigns the contents
        > count           returns the count of ticks
        > zero            returns the special duration value zero
        > min             returns the special duration value min
        > max             returns the special duration value max
        > operator+
        > operator-	        implements unary + and unary -
        > operator++
        > operator++(int)
        > operator--
        > operator--(int)     increments or decrements the tick count
        > operator+=
        > operator-=
        > operator*=
        > operator/=
        > operator%=  	    implements compound assignment between two durations

        Non-member functions
        > std::common_type<std::chrono::duration>                 specializes the std::common_type trait
        > operator+
        > operator-
        > operator*
        > operator/
        > operator%           implements arithmetic operations with durations as arguments

        > operator==
        > operator!=
        > operator<
        > operator<=
        > operator>
        > operator>=      compares two durations

        > duration_cast   converts a duration to another, with a different tick interval

        > floor(std::chrono::duration)    converts a duration to another, rounding down
        > ceil(std::chrono::duration)     converts a duration to another, rounding up
        > round(std::chrono::duration)    converts a duration to another, rounding to nearest, ties to even
        > abs(std::chrono::duration)      obtains the absolute value of the duration

        Helper types
        Type 	Definition
        > std::chrono::nanoseconds 	duration</*signed integer type of at least 64 bits, std::nano>
        > std::chrono::microseconds 	duration</*signed integer type of at least 55 bits, std::micro>
        > std::chrono::milliseconds 	duration</*signed integer type of at least 45 bits, std::milli>
        > std::chrono::seconds 	    duration</*signed integer type of at least 35 bits>
        > std::chrono::minutes 	    duration</*signed integer type of at least 29 bits, std::ratio<60>>
        > std::chrono::hours 	        duration</*signed integer type of at least 23 bits, std::ratio<3600>>

        Note: each of the predefined duration types covers a range of at least Â±292 years.

        Helper classes
        > treat_as_floating_point     indicates that a duration is convertible to duration with different tick period
        > duration_values             constructs zero, min, and max values of a tick count of given type

        > operator""ns            A std::chrono::duration literal representing nanoseconds


    2. Clocks:
    A clock consist of a starting point (or epoch) and a tick rate. For example, a clock
    may have an epoch of January 1, 1970 and tick every second. C++ defines three clock types:

        2.1 system_clock
            Member types
            rep 	    signed arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration
            period 	a   std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds
            duration 	std::chrono::duration<rep, period>, capable of representing negative durations
            time_point 	std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock>

            Member constants
            constexpr bool is_steady    true if the time between ticks is always constant, i.e. calls to now()
                                        return values that increase monotonically even in case of some external clock adjustment

            Member functions
            > now             returns a std::chrono::time_point representing the current point in time
            > to_time_t       converts a system clock time point to std::time_t
            > from_time_t     converts std::time_t to a system clock time point

        2.2 steady_clock
            Member types
            Member type 	Definition
            rep 	        arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration
            period      	a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds
            duration 	    std::chrono::duration<rep, period>
            time_point 	    std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::steady_clock>
            Member constants
            constexpr bool is_steady    steady clock flag, always true

            Member functions
            > now             returns a time_point representing the current value of the clock


        2.3 high_resolution_clock
            Member types
            Member type 	Definition
            rep 	        arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration
            period 	        a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds
            duration 	    std::chrono::duration<rep, period>
            time_point 	    std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::high_resolution_clock>

            Member constants
            constexpr bool is_steady    true if the time between ticks is always constant, i.e. calls to now()
                                        return values that increase monotonically even in case of some external
                                        clock adjustment
            Member functions
            > now             returns a std::chrono::time_point representing the current value of the clock

    3. Time point
    A time point is a duration fo time that had passed since the epoch of specific clock
    (defined in header <chrono>)
    time_point
        Member types
        Member type 	Definition
        clock 	        Clock, the clock on which this time point is measured
        duration 	    Duration, a std::chrono::duration type used to measure the time since epoch
        rep 	        Rep, an arithmetic type representing the number of ticks of the duration
        period 	        Period, a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the duration

        Member functions
        (constructor)       constructs a new time point
        time_since_epoch    returns the time point as duration since the start of its clock
        operator+=
        operator-=          modifies the time point by the given duration
        min                 returns the time point corresponding to the smallest duration
        max                 returns the time point corresponding to the largest duration

        Non-member functions
        std::common_type<std::chrono::time_point>       specializes the std::common_type trait

        operator+
        operator-   modifies the time point by the given duration

        operator==
        operator!=
        operator<
        operator<=
        operator>
        operator>=  compares two time points

        time_point_cast                     converts a time point to another time point on the same clock, with a different duration
        floor(std::chrono::time_point)      converts a time_point to another, rounding down
        ceil(std::chrono::time_point)       converts a time_point to another, rounding up
