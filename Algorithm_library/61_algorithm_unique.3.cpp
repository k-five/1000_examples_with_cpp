Algorithm Library C++
The algorithm library defines functions for a variety of purposes.
(e.g. searching, sorting, counting, manipulating ) that operate on
range of elements. Note that a range is defined as [ first, last )
where last refers to the element past the last element to inspect
or modify.

You can read the original implementation in:
stl_algobase.h and stl_algo.h and algorithmfwd.h

    copy
    copy_if             copies a range of elements to a new location

    replace
    replace_if          replaces all value satisfying specific criteria with another value

    rotate              rotate the order of elements in a range
    rotate_copy         copies and rotate a range of elements
    shuffle
    random_shuffle      randomly re-orders elements in a range

    (until c++ 17)(c++11)
    unique              removes consecutive duplicate element in a range

/// (until c++ 17)(c++11)
/// unique              removes consecutive duplicate element in a range
/// unique_copy         creates a copy a of some range of elements that contains no consecutive duplicate
// Removes all consecutive duplicate elements from the range [ first, last )
// and returns past-the-end iterator for the new logical end of the range.
//
// Removing is down by shifting the elements in the range in such a way
// that elements to be erased are overwriting.
//
// Relative order of the elements that remain is preserved and the physical
// size of the container is unchanged. iterator pointing to an element
// between the two logical end and the physical end of the range are
// still dereferenceable, but the elements themselves have unspecified
// value.
//
// A call to unique is typically followed by a call to a container's erase method,
// which erases the unique unspecified value and reduces the physical size
// of the container to match its new logical size.
