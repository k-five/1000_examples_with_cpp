Algorithm Library C++
The algorithm library defines functions for a variety of purposes.
(e.g. searching, sorting, counting, manipulating ) that operate on
range of elements. Note that a range is defined as [ first, last )
where last refers to the element past the last element to inspect
or modify.

/// rotate          Rotates the order of elements in a range
// Performs a left rotation on a range of elements.
// Specifically, std::rotate swaps the elements in the range [fist, last)
// in such a way that the element n_first becomes the first elements of the
// new range and n_first - 1 becomes the last element.
// A precondition of this function is that [first, n_first) and [n_first, last)
// are valid ranges.
//
//
// std::rotate is a common building block in many algorithms.
// This example demonstrates insertion sort:
int main(){
    std::vector<int> vec{2,4,3,0,5,10,7,3,7,1};
    std::cout<<"Before rotate:\t";        for(const int i : vec) std::cout<<i<<' ';

    // simple rotation to the left
    std::rotate(std::begin(vec),std::begin(vec)+3, std::end(vec));
    // It moves 3 element to the left, that it means is rotated
    // to the end and the 3 elements becomes the first element after rotating
    // 2 4 3 0 ... 3 7 1
    // becomes
    // 0 5 10 ... 2 4 3


    std::cout<<"\nAfter rotate:\t";       for(const int i : vec) std::cout<<i<<' ';
