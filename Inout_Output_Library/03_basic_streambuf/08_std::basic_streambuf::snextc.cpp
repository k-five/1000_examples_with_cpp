/**
int_type snextc();

Advances the input sequence by one character and reads one character.
The function calls sbumpc() to advance the input sequence. If that
function returns Traits::eof() meaning that input sequence has been
exhausted and uflow() could not relative more date, Traits::eof() is
returned. Otherwise sgetc() is called in order to read the character.
