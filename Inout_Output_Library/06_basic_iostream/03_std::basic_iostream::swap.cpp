/**
protected:
void swap ( basic_iostream& other);

Exchanges the state with another input / output stream object.
Effectively call basic_istream<charT, Traits>::swap(other).
This member function is protected: it is called by the swap
member function of the derived stream classes std::basic::stringstream
and std::fstream, which know how to correctly swap the associated stream buffer.
