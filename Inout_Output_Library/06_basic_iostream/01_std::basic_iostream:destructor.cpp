virtual ~basic_iostream();

Destructs the input / output stream

NOTE : this destructor does not perform any operation on the underlying
       stream buffer rdbuf(): the destructors of the derived stream such
       as std::basic_fstream and std::basic_stringstream are responsible
       for calling the destructor of the stream buffer.
